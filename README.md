# bh-inventory
The goal of this project is to rapidly improve BinaryHeart's inventory system. Once the new system is complete, it is intended to be open source so BinaryHeart chapters from across the country can improve it as needed. Additionally, other students, organizations or businesses that could benefit from this system could use and support it too. 

The incremental phases through which the system will be completed are enumerated as follows:

- [x] Phase 1: Automated Tasks
- [ ] Phase 2: Integrated Tasks
- [ ] Phase 3: Integrated Inventory
- [ ] Phase 4: Chapter Generalization
